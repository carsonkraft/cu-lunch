### Purpose 

Food is an instrumental factor in aiding with socialization because, frankly speaking, it is a commonality that we all need to eat to live. However, in college, finding someone to share a meal with can be tricky because of the various schedules. Upperclassmen wean themselves off the meal plans in hopes of saving money and eating food of their desire. The reality of the situation is, these same students, due to their busy schedules and laziness, end up following an unhealthy diet of coffee, ramen, and energy drinks. Meanwhile, underclassmen are forced to take extraordinary meal plans that result in a wastage of meal swipes. 

Here is where CU@Lunch comes to the rescue, by pairing students in need of swipes with students who have excess swipes, while also creating an opportunity to meet someone new over a meal. Furthermore, underclassmen have the opportunity to find mentorship in upperclassmen by exchanging meal swipes with them. Users create a profile where they indicate when and where they plan on eating and if they need or can offer a meal swipe. The website then allows students to search and choose a match for lunch based on their time and preferred dining hall. 

The advantages include no wastage of meal swipes, meeting other students at Columbia and Barnard, and ensuring those who would like to eat at the dining hall are given the opportunity to. This will increase the probability that users are eating a healthier diet and bridge the gap between students. 

What's a swipe?

A 'swipe' is a transaction done using a University ID card to enter a dining hall. At Columbia/Barnard specifically, students can opt for a lump sum of meal swipes for the semester or weekly allotted swipes.
